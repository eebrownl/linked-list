# linked-list

In this project the goal was to create a linked list by creating 2 classes: one to create new nodes in the list and one for the actual methods necessary for the creation and maintenance of the list. 

Post-mortem: 
The project was pretty straightforward. I'm not sure if there are other methods I might want if I were maintaining a linked list, but I think they would be pretty easy to create if I found that I needed them.
